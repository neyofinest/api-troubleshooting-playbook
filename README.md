## API Troubleshooting Playbook

This repository contains practical guides, notes, and examples for debugging REST APIs, webhooks, and cloud integration issues.
It also includes simple Java scripts used to simulate API checks and demonstrate basic troubleshooting workflows.

What’s Inside

  * Java examples
    * HealthCheck.java – Simulated API endpoint check

  * Troubleshooting notes
    * Common API errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 500)
    * Debugging authentication issues (OAuth2, API keys)
    * Webhook debugging workflow
    *  Timeout & latency investigations
   
  * Tools used
    * Postman
    * cURL
    * AWS CLI
    * Kibana / CloudWatch logs

## Purpose of This Repository

This repo demonstrates my ability to:

- Document technical troubleshooting steps
- Work with GitHub (commits, branches, PRs)
- Write and modify simple Java code
- Understand API and cloud debugging workflows
- Use engineering practices similar to Support Engineers

## Example Java Script

The HealthCheck.java file simulates a simple health-check workflow:

```java
System.out.println("Performing API health check...");
System.out.println("Status: OK (simulated)");
```



More Java examples will be added as I continue learning.
## Future Additions
- Real Java HTTP client example
- API retry logic
- Webhook signature verification example
- Small open-source documentation PRs
